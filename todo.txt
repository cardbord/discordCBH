What we have to do:
1. Eat cheese
    -maintaining high calcium levels is important for bone structure
    -don't workout properly anyway so this is necessary
2. make some sort of context management
    -class, referenced in commands
    -contains user, server, channel, (if voice maybe if needed, need to read dc docs to see properly)
3. make commands
    -function decorator 'command', wraps functs and allat
    -i'll just borrow syntax from catchers extdpy module because thats pretty snazzy
4. make a system of pushing commands to discord
    -write json
    -post to dc
    -maybe write a little subset of functions to make this easier (if i'm lazy)
5. make networks
    -management of commands from multiple files 
    -basically just compile functions together and then implement step 4
6. make localhost
    -yoooo lets learn css
    -small localhost script
7. make inbuilt localhost functions
    -slightly harder to implement but we can figure something out
    IDEAS:
        -restart bot button
        -terminal: detailing errors and improvements
        -(config file for terminal for certain outputs)
        -server list
        -leave server
        -server members
        -manage members
8. testing fun!
    -will take a while lol
    -make a functioning bot using all basic commands
    -test localhost terminal
